# Squash
my app called squash. just like yik yak. The app is public but my back-end repository is still pirvate.

It features recyclerview pagination, location based subjects, location based sticky post, location based post, and anonymity.

The features being worked on right now are:
-bugs
-location post frequency heatmap
-more profile features
-dark theme, other settings
