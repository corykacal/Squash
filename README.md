# Squash
my app called squash. Inspired by yik yak, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yik_Yak. The app is public but my back-end repository is still pirvate.

It features recyclerview pagination, location based subjects, location based sticky post, location based post, and anonymity.

The features being worked on right now are:

-bugs

-location post frequency heatmap

-more profile features

-image compression and image upload limits

-spam protection on frontend and backend

-more error handling to make things atomic

-twitter reply style post making

-dark theme, other settings
